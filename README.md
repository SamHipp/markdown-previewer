Markdown Previewer
================================

This is an app that automatically converts text typed in the input field into marked-down text. The resulting text can then be copy-pasted into your word processor of choice.

Getting Started
-----------------
Simply type whatever you'd like into the field at the top of the page, and the marked-down text will appear in the area below it. Then, use the "copy" button located at the bottom of the output field to copy the marked-down text to your clipboard for later use.

Usage
-----------------
The markdown parser follows the conventions of [common mark 0.30](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/) and [Github flavored markdown 0.29](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
